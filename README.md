My old research project. The challenge was to build a system to controll multiple arduino schemes from multiple android devices. <br>
This project consists of 3 parts:
 - Fantastic - arduino sketch. Can be loaded at any arduino or esp board.
 - Allonsy - a desktop app to host a server. It maps and transfers commands to each arduino scheme.
 - Geronimo - an android app that provides an oppotunity to controll arduino board.

**Platform -** Arduino + Desktop server + Android <br>
**Language -** C, Java, Kotlin <br>
**Frameworks & libraries -** JSerialComm, Coroutines <br>
**Architecture -** Simplyfied
